# WBS_Webscraping_API
Connecting different data sources (accessed via webscraping and the use of API-calls) in a single relational database

The notebooks found in this repository are part of a project of another fictious company, this time GANS - a company active in the E-scooter-rental business.
The task was to provide the executives of this company with weather forecasts and flight schedule information in major European cities in order to allow in-time-deployment of scooters at European airports.

An in-depth explanation of this project is to be found on medium: https://medium.com/@dkrejcik80/an-absolute-beginners-approach-to-data-engineering-fe19f375454a

Note: the notebooks use API-calls, the name of the files only reflects the removal of personal API-keys
